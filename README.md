# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the final project to prove the mastery of front-end software development course from Meta Coursera.
It has helped me to put a lot of the very detailed skills I learnt into practice. I am still interested 
in improving the app. I see that I need to learn more about unit test and testing in general. I am still learning
and aspire to be a well-grounded software engineer soon!
